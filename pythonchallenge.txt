**page source** means the current web page source.
Open the html page source and note the comments.

[white]#equality#

=== 3
Note the page title. It's a hint!
Need to view the page source as above.

[white]#linkedlist#

=== 4
The page title says "follow the chain", so click the image

Need to get the page by program, and extract a number from the source.

**Brillient problem!!** Follow the number and you'll get a page that doesn't has a number in it, but since the we write a loop to append the number to the url, this time we append **NULL**.

The answer is lay in the page that has no number in it. It's a cyclic list and you'll get the page again and again, the length of the cycle is 194.

[white]#nothing, 6711, ..., 66831 and then will get the answer peak#

=== 5
peak hell sounds familiar?
Download a file whose name is in the source code and unpickle it.

Then! The unpicked list is a character map!
[white]#channel#

=== 6
The comment of the page source only has "zip", I googled and download channel.zip. Unzip it and there are many _num.txt_ files in it, other than a _readme_ file with two hints.

It seems similar with **linkedlist** problem, but the last file in the list says "Collect the comments."

Need to know that the comments here is in the zipfile, i.e. each file in the zip file can have a comment, here we need to collect these comments following the list order and will got the answer, say XXX.

The final answer is the small characters which forms XXX!!! Amazing, I googled a lot!
